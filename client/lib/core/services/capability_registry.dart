/// Gateway capability discovery for the Hermes Android shell.
///
/// Phase 0 of the roadmap requires every later
/// feature to be capability-aware rather than to assume the newest gateway.
/// The registry answers one question — *may I call this method?* — from three
/// sources, in increasing order of authority:
///
/// 1. the `gateway.ready` capability advertisement;
/// 2. a successful call (proof the method exists);
/// 3. an unknown-method error (proof it does not).
///
/// The central compatibility rule is that **silence is not a denial**. Older
/// gateways implement methods they never advertise, so an absent family yields
/// [CapabilitySupport.unknown] and the caller is expected to try the call and
/// report the outcome back through [recordSuccess] / [recordFailure]. Only a
/// real unknown-method response downgrades a method to
/// [CapabilitySupport.unsupported], which lets the UI show a calm compatibility
/// notice instead of an error.
